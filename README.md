Swag Badge Battery Pack.
========================

At LCA 2021, many attendees were given a [Swag
Badge](http://www.openhardwareconf.org/wiki/Swagbadge2021).  
The swag badge has an ESP32 with WiFi and Bluetooth (it can't connect
to WPA-Enterprise networks though!), a couple of Oled displays, and a
heap of connectivity possibilities.

It can be powered from a micro-USB connector.

But if it is to be used as a _badge_ it needs portable power.

I'm trying to design a battery holder for an 1100mAH LiPo (usualy used
for small RC helicopters).
